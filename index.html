      <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
      <p>
        Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest
        son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and
        Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a "godfather" or "don,"
        the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his
        father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has
        returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family
        business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia
        Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns
        for the first time about the family "business." A few months later at
        Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the
        employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the
        Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father
        from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded
        eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen
        (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to
        exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police
        captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a
        gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael
        marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on
        Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by
        Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry
        him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that
        another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics
        endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as
        the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then
        launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to
        wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing
        his own moral downfall.
